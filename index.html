    <p> [A warm summer evening,
        <br/> just outside the heart of the city,
        <br/> seconds bleeding into minutes, into hours.] </p>
    <br/>
    <p> The doorbell rings in apartment 7A, prompting Mr. Barton to rise from his sofa and walk towards the door. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>[Unfortunately, Mr. Barton is the absentminded type, and while he knows to be careful in such a bustling city, he never checks the peephole before opening the door.]</p>
    <br/>
    <p> Mr. Barton opens the door. On the other side is a familiar face (but not the good kind); the familiar face smiles, and Mr. Barton begins to feel the walls around him swirl. The shock of seeing this dangerously familiar face causes him to faint.<p/>
    <br/>
    <p>The impact of Mr. Barton’s large body on the hardwood floor startles Aberdeen, resident of apartment 6A directly below. Aberdeen, who is currently adding vanilla extract to her famous banana bread batter, drops the bottle in her shock. The extract splatters on the floor and the surrounding cupboards. A potent vanilla scent fills the entire kitchen and wafts into nearby vents. </p>
    <br/>
    <p> As Aberdeen scrambles to clean up the mess, Charles of 6B next door detects the odor, and, upon realizing that Aberdeen is making banana bread, rushes to ask for a piece. He hurriedly darts for the door, tripping over the charging cord for his daughter’s hoverboard. In his hurry, he forgets that it was unplugged because it was already fully charged. Charles, thinking that it's almost dead, plugs it back in and walks out the door. </p>

    <br/>
    <p> The overcharged hoverboard begins to heat up and subsequently catches on fire. The smoke detector, now triggered, alerts the nearby fire department. </p>
    <br/>
    <p> As a fire truck leaves to address the problem, its sirens become louder and louder. </p>
    <br/>
    <p> The familiar face in apartment 7B hears these sirens and begins to panic, thinking that someone called the police. Unable to carry out the plan, the familiar face turns to flee.  </p>
    <br/>
    <p> Mr. Barton wakes up to the sound of sirens, still alive and unable to remember the past three minutes. </p>
